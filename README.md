**FOR loop** in c language  
FOR(intialize variable; condition; incremenbt/decrement){}   
e.g   
FOR(int i = ; i<= 10; i++)   
{  
  printf("Hello World");  
}  
the for loop is first executed form left to right, then after completing first cycle it will go in reverse  
in first cycle it will initialize i, then check the condition, if true, it will go inside the loop, then it will go back in reverse, it will first incerement then check the condition 

**While**
while(confition){}

**do while**
do
{
  statement
}
while(condition);

it is similar to repeat until, it will execute atleast once
